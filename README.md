## üìö How It Works

- The bot logs in as your Discord account.
- It sends the `/bump` command in your chosen channel at random intervals (between 2 and 2.5 hours).
- Each bump is logged in a separate channel for tracking.
- Random intervals help avoid detection by automated systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced & Production Run

For long-term or production use, you can run the bot with [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/), a process manager that keeps your bot alive and restarts it if it crashes.

### 1. Install PM2 Globally

```bash
npm install pm2 -g
```

### 2. Start the Bot with PM2

```bash
pm2 start index.js
```

This will keep your bot running in the background, even after you close your terminal.

To view logs:

```bash
pm2 logs index
```

To stop the bot:

```bash
pm2 stop index
```
